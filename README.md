### LangChain / LangGraph usage by file

| File | What it uses |
|---|---|
| `agents/state.py` | `BaseMessage`, `Annotated` list with `operator.add` reducer |
| `agents/nodes.py` | `ChatGroq` (langchain-groq), `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `SystemMessage` |
| `agents/study_coach_agent.py` | `StateGraph`, `add_edge`, `add_conditional_edges`, `compile()` |
| `tools/rag_tool.py` | `Chroma` (langchain-chroma), `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, `Document` |

## Model Performance

Best model selected by GridSearchCV: **Logistic Regression**

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | 1.00 (100%) |
| Precision | 1.00 (100%) |
| Recall | 1.00 (100%) |
| F1 Score | 1.00 (100%) |

> **Why are all metrics 1.0?**
> The dataset used is synthetic — the `pass_fail` label is deterministically derived from the average of `math_score`, `reading_score`, and `writing_score`. Because the target is a direct function of input features, the model learns a perfect rule and achieves 100% on all metrics. On a real-world dataset with noisy, independently collected labels, these scores would be lower and more representative.

## Setup

### 1. Clone and create a virtual environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd student_pass-fail_predicting_ml_model
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```

- Free Groq key: [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
- Free Tavily key: [tavily.com](https://tavily.com)

### 3. Train the model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

Runs the 8-step pipeline: load → fill nulls → remove outliers → scale → SMOTE → train classifiers → KMeans → save artifacts to `models/`.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## ML Training Pipeline

Run via `python train_model.py`. Eight sequential steps:

### Step 1 — Load data
Reads `data/student_data.csv` using pandas and prints the row count and column list.

### Step 2 — Fill null values (`fill_nulls`)
For each of the 9 feature columns, missing values are filled with that column's **median**. Median is used instead of mean to be robust against skewed distributions.

### Step 3 — Remove outliers (`remove_outliers`)
Applies the **IQR method** to each feature column:
- Computes Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
- Removes rows where a value falls outside `[Q1 − 1.5×IQR, Q3 + 1.5×IQR]`
- Skips columns with IQR = 0 to avoid dropping all rows for constant-value columns

### Step 4 — Preprocess features and target (`preprocess`)
- Encodes the target: `pass_fail` → 1 (Pass) or 0 (Fail)
- Prints class distribution (Pass % vs Fail %)
- Applies a **1%–99% percentile clip** on each feature to suppress extreme values before scaling
- Scales all 9 features to [0, 1] using **MinMaxScaler** (`fit_transform`)

### Step 5 — Split and balance (`split_and_balance`)
- Splits data into **80% train / 20% test** with `stratify=y` to preserve class proportions
- Applies **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to the training set only, so the minority class (Fail or Pass) is synthetically oversampled to balance the training distribution
- The test set is never touched by SMOTE — it stays as real data

### Step 6 — Train and evaluate classifiers (`train_and_evaluate`)
Two candidate models are trained using **GridSearchCV** with 3-fold Stratified K-Fold cross-validation, scored by weighted F1:

| Model | Hyperparameters searched |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | `C ∈ {0.1, 1.0, 10.0}` |
| XGBoost | `n_estimators ∈ {50, 100}`, `max_depth ∈ {3, 6}`, `learning_rate ∈ {0.05, 0.1}` |

The model with the highest weighted F1 on the test set is selected as the best model.

### Step 7 — KMeans clustering (`train_kmeans`)
Fits a **KMeans** model with 3 clusters on the scaled training data. Clusters group students into performance bands (e.g. high achievers, average, at-risk) and are used in the dashboard to show which group a student belongs to.

### Step 8 — Save artifacts (`save_artifacts`)
Saves all trained objects to the `models/` directory using joblib:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `model.pkl` | Best trained classifier |
| `scaler.pkl` | Fitted MinMaxScaler |
| `kmeans.pkl` | Fitted KMeans |
| `meta.pkl` | Best model name + accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores |
| `feature_names.pkl` | Scaled feature names array |
| `input_feature_cols.pkl` | List of input feature column names |
